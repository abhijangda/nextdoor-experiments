# Results and Analysis

We are gradually adding summaries of our results to these web pages (please let us know if you would like other comparisons). These summaries also include a table of results along with links to the configuration and results of each individual run. We detail our [methodology for our measurements here](https://gunrock.github.io/docs/#methodology).

For reproducibility, we maintain Gunrock configurations and results in our github [gunrock/io](https://github.com/gunrock/io/tree/master/gunrock-output) repository.

We are happy to run experiments with other engines, particularly if those engines output results in our JSON format / a format that can be easily parsed into JSON format.

## Preliminary Performance Results

The following are some preliminary performance results. It is meant to give a rough idea
of how Gunrock performs with specific version, testing environment, parameters
and datasets. The numbers may change (with very high chances in reality),
throughout the development of the library, and / or with different environments,
running parameters and datasets. If more accurate numbers (e.g. for comparison
in a paper), or results with different parameters / datasets, please contact
the developers of Gunrock.

### General remarks

- All timings are shown in Millisecond (ms).
- Abreviation:

  - CSR   = compressed sparse row
  - CSC   = compressed sparse column
  - D     = directed
  - UD    = undirected
  - SOC   = social graph
  - MTEPS = million traversed edges per second
  - MTVPS = million traversed vertices per second
  - V     = vertex
  - E     = edge
  - H     = hardware
  - S     = software
  - G     = Gunrock
  - P     = parameter

- Load time includes graph generation (for synthetic graphs) or raw data reading
(for real graphs) + format conversion (to CSR and / or CSC, to UD, when necessary) time
- Preprocess time includes memory allocation, graph partition (for multiple GPU) and
initial data transmission (CPU -> GPU) time
- Process time is the actual algorithm running time on GPU
- Postprocess time includes resulted data transmission (GPU -> CPU), verification and
clean-up time
- The total time of our results are dominated by load / write time (our server
is not optimized for data load / write performance). The processing time may be a better
indicator of performance.

#### Paramters

- P1 = --traversal-mode=1 --device=2 --quick --delta=0.85 --error=0.001 --max-iter=100 --normalized --queue-sizing=1 --queue-sizing1=0

#### Remarks

- PR has two formulations, and Gunrock has both implemented. The
unnormalized one is the one described by the original PR paper;
it does not converge and can be called by not passing --normalized
to the Gunrock executable. The normalized one is the one that actually
converge, and can be called by passing --normalized to the Gunrock
executable.
- No special treatment is used for 0-out degree vertices, and we use
a directed graph, so ranks can escape from those vertices. There is a
way to solve this by distributing the rank of those vertices to all
vertices. This should make the total rank always equal to 1 (when using
the normalized formula), but we have not implemented this yet.

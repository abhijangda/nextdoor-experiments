# Scaling analysis for HIVE applications

The purpose of this study is to understand how the HIVE v0
applications would scale out on multiple GPUs, with a focus on the
DGX-1 platform. Before diving into per-application analysis, we give a
brief summary of the potential hardware platforms, the communication
methods and models, and graph partitioning schemes.

## Hardware platforms

There are at least three kinds of potential multi-GPU platforms for
HIVE apps. They have different GPU communication properties, and that
may affect the choice of communication models and/or graph
partitioning schemes, thus may have different scaling results.

### DGX-1

The DGX-1 with P100 GPUs has 4 NVLink lanes per GPU, connected as
follows. ![DGX1-NVLink](../attachments/scaling/NVLink-DGX1.png "DGX1
NVLink Topology")

Each of the NVLink links runs at 20 GBps per direction, higher than
PCIe 3.0 x16 (16 GBps for the whole GPU). But the topology is not
all-to-all, and GPUs may not be able to access every other GPU's
memory. For example, GPU0 can't use peer access on GPUs 5, 6 and 7.
This makes implementations using peer access more complex than a full
all-to-all topology. DGX-1 with V100 GPUs increases the NVLink speed
to 25 GBps per direction per lane, and increases the number of lanes
per GPU to 6, but peer accessibility has not been changed. This issue
is finally addressed in DGX-2 with the NVSwitch.

Using a benchmark program to test throughput and latency shows the
following results. `Self` indicates local GPU accesses, `peer`
indicates peer accesses, `host` indicates accesses to the CPU memory
via UVM, and `all` indicates accesses to all peer-accessible GPUs. The
`regular` operations access the memory in continous places by neighboring
threads; in CUDA terms, these operations are coalesced memory accesses. The
`random` operations access the memory space randomly, and neighboring threads
may be touching memory that are far away from each other; in CUDA terms, these
operations are non-coalesced memory accesses. The memory access patterns of
graph workflows are a mix of both, and one main target of kernel optimizations
is to make the memory accesses as coalesced as possible. But at the end,
depending on the algorithm, some random accesses may be unavoiable. Random
accesses across GPUs are particularly slow.

Throughput in GBps:

| Operation      | Self | Peer | Host | All |
|----------------|------:|------:|------:|-----:|
| Regular read   | 448.59 | 14.01 | 444.74 | 12.17 |
| Regular write  | 442.98 | 16.21 | 16.18 | 12.17 |
| Regular update | 248.80 | 11.71 | 0.0028 | 6.00 |
| Random read    | 6.78 | 1.43 | 2.39 | 4.04 |
| Random write   | 6.63 | 1.14 | 3.47E-5 | 3.82 |
| Random update  | 3.44 | 0.83 | 1.92E-5 | 2.08 |

Latency in microseconds (us):

| Operation      | Self | Peer | Host | All |
|----------------|------:|------:|------:|-----:|
| Regular read   | 2.12 | 1.18 | 1.30 | 1.49 |
| Regular write  | 1.74 | 1.00 | 13.83 | 1.01 |
| Regular update | 2.43 | 1.20 | 79.29 | 1.44 |
| Random read    | 3.11 | 1.08 | 13.61 | 1.40 |
| Random write   | 3.28 | 1.05 | 15.88 | 1.39 |
| Random update  | 5.69 | 1.28 | 21.76 | 1.38 |

All the regular throughputs are at least 80% of their theoretical
upper bounds. The latencies when accessing local GPUs seem odd, but
other latencies look reasonable. It's clear that local regular
accesses have much higher throughput than inter-GPU connections, about
20 to 30 times from this experiment. The ratio of random accesses are
lower, but still at about 5 times. The implication on the
scalabilities of graph applications is that for scalable behavior, the
local-memory-access-to-communication ratio needs to be at least 10 to 1.
Because most graph implementations are memory bound, the
computation cost is counted by the number of elements accessed by the
kernels; this means the computation to communication ratio should be
at least 2.5 operations to 1 byte to exhibit scalable behavior.

Unified virtual memory (UVM) doesn't work as expected for most cases,
instead only when the accesses are read only and the data can be
duplicated on each GPU. Otherwise the throughputs are significantly
lower, caused by memory migration and going over the PCIe interfaces.
The less than 0.5 GBps throughputs from write and update operations via
UVM could possibily caused by problems in the UVM support or the way how
UVM is configured in the benchmark code.
It must be noted that, at the time of testing, the DGX-1 has CUDA 9.1
and NVIDIA driver 390.30 installed, which are more than one year old.
A newer CUDA version and NVIDIA driver could potentially improve the
UVM performance. Testing using V100 GPUs with CUDA 10.0 and NVIDIA
driver 410 shows considerablly better throughputs.

### DGX-2

The DGX-2 system has a very different NVLink topology: the GPUs are
connected by NVSwitches, and all to all peer accesses are available.

![DGX2-NVLink](../attachments/scaling/NVLink-DGX2.png "DGX2 NVLink Topology").

At the time of this report, the DGX-2 is hardly available, and not to
us. What we have locally at UC Davis are two Quadro GV100 GPUs
directly connected by 4 NVLink2 lanes. Although the setup is much
smaller than the DGX-2, it still can provide some ideas on how the
inter-GPU communication would perform on the DGX-2.

Throughput in GBps

| Operation      | Self | Peer | Host | All |
|----------------|------:|------:|------:|-----:|
| Regular read   | 669.68 | 76.74 | 679.52 | 76.72 |
| Regular write  | 590.01 | 85.00 | 170.113 | 76.28 |
| Regular update | 397.26 | 39.67 | 80.00 | 37.86 |
| Random read    | 17.39 | 7.46 | 17.27 | 10.51 |
| Random write   | 13.25 | 7.96 | 1.23 | 7.24 |
| Random update  |  6.83 | 3.88 | 0.68 | 3.85 |

Latency in microsecond (us)

| Operation      | Self | Peer | Host | All  |
|----------------|-----:|-----:|-----:|-----:|
| Regular read   | 0.37 | 0.47 | 0.37 | 0.41 |
| Regular write  | 0.08 | 0.08 | 0.08 | 0.15 |
| Regular update | 0.37 | 0.47 | 0.43 | 0.41 |
| Random read    | 0.11 | 0.10 | 0.10 | 0.16 |
| Random write   | 0.13 | 0.08 | 0.08 | 0.15 |
| Random update  | 0.15 | 0.09 | 0.09 | 0.17 |

On this machine configuration, the local-to-peer memory throughput
ratios, about 8 for regular accesses and about 2 for random accesses,
are much lower than the DGX-1. The decreases are mainly from using all
the 4 lanes for communication, instead of 1 in the DGX-1 cases. If
using only a single lane, the ratios would become 32 and 8, even
higher than the DGX-1. The actual effect from the NVSwitch is still
unclear, but DGX-2 is expected to have similar scalabilities as DGX-1
for graph applications.

### GPU clusters

Going from multiple GPUs within the same node to multiple GPUs across
different nodes significantly decreases the inter-GPU throughput.
While NVLink runs at 80 GBps per direction per GPU for the DGX-1, the
aggregated InfiniBand bandwidth is only 400 Gbps, which is only one
twelfth of the aggregated inter-GPU bandwidth. This means the local
access-to-communication-bandwidth ratio drops an order of magnitude,
making scaling graph applications across nodes a corresponding order
of magnitude harder. Using the same approximation method as the DGX-1,
a graph implementation needs to have 30 operations / local memory
operations for each byte going across the nodes. The implementation
focus may need to switch to communication, rather than local
computation, to achieve a scalable implementation on GPU clusters.

## Communication methods / models

There are multiple ways to move data between GPUs: explicit movement,
peer accesses, and unified virtual memory (UVM). They have different
performance and implications in implementing graph workflows.

### Explicit data movement

The most traditional way to communicate is to explicitly move the
data: use `cudaMemcpyAsync` to copy a block of memory from one GPU to
another. The source and destination GPUs are not required to be peer
accessible. CUDA will automatically select the best route: if GPUs are
peer-accessible, the traffic will go through the inter-GPU connection,
be it NVLink or PCIe; if they are not peer-accessible, the data will
be first copied to CPU memory, and then copied to the destination GPU.

One of the advantage of explicit data movement is throughput.
`cudaMemcpyAsync` is highly optimized, and the data for communication
are always dense. The throughput should be close to the hardware
limit, if the size of data is not too small, say at least a few tens
of MB. Explicit data movement also isolates local computation and
communication. Because there is no need to consider the data layout or
different access latencies from local or remote data, the implementation
and optimization of computation kernels can be much simpler. It also
enables connection to other communication libraries, such as MPI.

However, explicit memory copy requires that data for communication are
packed in a continuous memory space. For most applications, this means
additional computation to prepare the data. Since the computing power
of GPUs is huge, and graph applications are mostly memory-bound, this
extra computation should only have minimal impact on the running time.

Many graph algorithms are written using the bulk synchronous parallel
(BSP) model: computations are carried out in iterations, and the
results of computation are only guaranteed to be visible after the
iteration boundary. The BSP model provides a natural communication
point: at the iteration boundary. The current Gunrock multi-GPU
framework follows the BSP model.

Depending on the algorithm, there are several communication models
that can be used:

- **Peer to host GPU**
This communication model is used when data of a vertex or edge on peer
GPUs need to be accumulated / aggregated onto the host GPU of the
vertex. When the vertex or edge is only adjacent to a few GPUs, it may
be beneficial to use direct p2p communication; when the vertex is
adjacent to most GPUs, a `Reduce` from all GPUs to the host GPU may be
better.

- **Host GPU to peers**
This is the opposite to the peer-to-host model. It propagates data of
a vertex or edge from its host GPU to all GPUs adjacent to the vertex.
Similarly, if the number of adjacent GPUs are small, point-to-point
communication should do the work; otherwise, `broadcast` from the host
GPU may be better.

- **All reduce**
When updates on the same vertex or edge come from many GPUs, and the
results are needed on many GPUs, `AllReduce` may be the best choice. It
can be viewed as an `peers to host` followed by an `host to peers`
communication. It can also be used without partitioning the graph: it
works without knowing or assigning a host GPU to an vertex or edge.

- **Mix all reduce with peers to host GPU or host GPU to peers**
This is a mix of `AllReduce` and peer-to-peer communications: for vertices or
edges that touch a large number of GPUs, `AllReduce` is used; for other
vertices or edges, direct peer-to-peer communications are used. This
communication model is coupled with the high / low degree partitioning scheme.
The paper "Scalable Breadth-First Search on a GPU Cluster"
<https://escholarship.org/uc/item/9bd842z6> has more details on this model.

### Peer accesses

If a pair of GPUs is peer-accessible, they can directly dereference each other's
memory pointers within CUDA kernels. This provides a more asynchronous way for
inter-GPU communication: there is no need to wait for the iteration boundary.
Atomic operations are also supported if the GPUs are connected by NVLink. The
implementation can also be kept simple, since no data preparing and explicit
movement is needed. The throughput is also acceptable, although not as good as
explicit movement.

However, this essentially forces the kernel to work on a NUMA (non-uniform
memory access) domain formed by local and remote GPU memory. Some kernels
optimized under the assumption of a flat memory domain may not work well. Peer
accesses also give up the opportunity to aggregate local updates on the same
vertex or edge before communication, so the actual communication volume may be
larger.

### Unified virtual memory (UVM)

UVM is similar to peer accesses, as it also enables multiple GPUs to access the
same memory space. However, the target memory space is allocated in the CPU
memory. When needed on a GPU, a memory page will be moved to the GPU's memory
via the page fault mechanism. Updates to the data are cached in GPU memory
first, and will eventually be written to the CPU memory. UVM provides a
transparent view of the CPU memory on GPU, and significantly reduces the coding
complexity if running time is not a concern. It also enables the GPU to process
datasets that can't fit in combined GPU memory without explicitly streaming
the data from CPU to GPU.

But there are some caveats. The actual placement of a memory
page/piece of data relies on hints given by `cudaMemAdvise`, otherwise
it will need to be fetched from CPU to GPU when first used by any GPU,
and bounces between GPUs when updated by multiple GPUs. The hints
essentially come from partitioning the data, but sometimes there is no
good way to partition, and data bouncing is unavoidable. In the worst
cases, the data can be moved back to CPU, and any further access will
need to go through the slow PCIe bridge again. The performance of UVM
is not as good as explicit data movement or peer accesses; in the
worst cases, it can be a few orders of magnitude slower. When data is
larger than the GPU memory, UVM's throughput drops significantly; as a
result, it's easier to code, but it will be slower than streaming the
graph for datasets larger than GPU memory.

## Graph partitioning scheme

Graphs may be cut into smaller pieces to put them onto multiple GPUs.
Duplicating the graph on each may work for some problems, provided the
graph is not too large; but duplication is not suitable for all
problems, and does not scale in graph size. Graph partitioning is a
long-lasting research topic, and we decided to use existing
partitioners, such as Metis, instead of implementing some complicated
ones of our own. A large number of graphs, especially those with high
connectivities, are really difficult to partition; our results suggest
that random partitioning works quite well in terms of time taken by
the partitioner, load balancing, programming simplicity and still
manageable communication cost. By default, Gunrock uses the random
partitioner.

What makes a bigger difference is the partitioning scheme: whether the
graph is partitioned in 1 dimension, 2 dimensions, or differently for
low and high degree vertices.

### 1D partitioning

1D partitioning distributes the edges in a graph either by the source vertices
or the destination vertices. It's simple to work with, and scales well when the
number of GPUs are small. It should still work on the DGX-1 with 8 GPUs for a
large number of graph applications. But that may approach 1D partitioning's
scalability limit.

### 2D partitioning

2D partitioning distributes the edges by both the source and the destination
vertices. When a graph is visualized in a dense matrix representation, 2D
partitioning is like cutting the matrix by a 2D grid. 8 GPUs in the DGX-1 may
be too small for 2D partitioning to be useful; it may worth trying out on DGX-2
with 16 GPUs. 2D partitioning of sparse graphs may create significant load
imbalance between partitions.

### High/low degree partitioning

The main idea of high/low degree partitioning is simple: for vertices
with low out-degrees and their outgoing edges, distribute edges based
on their source vertices; for vertices with high out-degrees and their
outgoing edges, distribute edges based on the destination vertices;
if both vertices have high out-degrees, distribute the edge based on
the one with lower degree. The result is that low degree vertices are
only adjacent to very few GPUs, while high degree vertices' edges are
scattered among all GPUs. Graph applications scale very well when
using the p2p communication model for low degree vertices, and the
`AllReduce` model for high degree vertices.

## Scaling of the HIVE applications

The target platform DGX-1 has 8 GPUs. Although that is more than we
normally see for single scaling studies, the simple 1D graph
partitioning scheme should (in general) still work. The marginal
performance improvement by using more GPUs may be insignificant at
this scale, and a small number of applications might even see
performance decreases with some datasets. However, the 1D partitioning
makes the scaling analysis simple and easily understandable. If other
partitioning schemes could work better for a specific application, it
would be noted.

### How scaling is considered

The bandwidth of NVLink is much faster than PCIe 3.0: 20x3 and 25x6
GBps bidirectionally for each Tesla P100 and V100 GPUs respectively in
an DGX-1. But compared to the several TFLOPs computing power and
several hundred GBps device bandwidth, the inter-GPU bandwidth is
still considerably less. For any application to have good scalability,
the communication time should be able to be either: 1) hidden by
overlap with computation, or 2) kept as a small portion of the
computation. The computation-to-communication ratio is a good
indicator to predict the scalability: a higher ratio means better
scalability. Specific to the DGX-1 system with P100 GPUs, a ratio
larger than about 10 to 1 is expected for an app to have at least
marginal scalability. For GPUs newer than P100, the computation power
and memory bandwidth improve faster than interconnect bandwidth, so
the compute-to-communicate ratio needs to grow even more to start
seeing positive scaling.

### Community Detection (Louvain)

The main and most time-consuming part of the Louvain algorithm is the
modularity optimization iterations. The aggregated edge weights
between vertices and their respective adjacent communities, as well as
the outgoing edge weights of each community, are needed for the
modularity optimization. The vertex-community weights can be computed
locally, if the community assignments of all neighbors of local
vertices are available; to achieve this, a vertex needs to broadcast
its new community when the assignment changes. The per-community
outgoing edge weights can be computed by `AllReduce` across all GPUs.
The modularity optimization with inter-GPU communication can be done
as:

```
Do
    Local modularity optimization;
    Broadcast updated community assignments of local vertices;
    local_weights_community2any := sums(local edges from an community);
    weights_community2any := AllReduce(local_weights_community2any, sum);
While iterations stop condition not met
```

The local computation cost is on the order of $O(|E| + |V|)/p$, but
with a large constant hidden by the $O()$ notation. From experiments,
the constant factor is about 10, considering the cost of sort or the
random memory access penalty of hash table. The community assignment
broadcast has a cost of |V| x 4 bytes, and the 'AllReduce' costs $2|V|
\times 8$ bytes. These communication costs are the upper bound,
assuming there are $|V|$ communities, and all vertices update their
community assignments. In practice, the communication cost can be much
lower, depending on the dataset.

  The graph contraction can be done as below on multiple GPUs:

```
temp_graph := Contract the local sub-graph based on community assignments;
Send edges <v, u, w> in temp_graph to host_GPU(v);
Merge received edges and form the new local sub-graph;
```

In the worst case, assuming the number of edges in the contracted
graph is $|E'|$, the communication cost could be $|E'| \times 8$
bytes, with the computation cost at about $5|E|/p + |E'|$. For most
datasets, the size reduction of graph from the contraction step is
significant, so the memory needed to receive edges from the peer GPUs
is manageable; however, if $|E'|$ is large, it can be significant and
may run out of GPU memory.

*Summary of Louvain multi-GPU scaling*

Because the modularity optimization runs multiple iterations before each graph
contraction phase, the computation and communication of modularity optimization
is dominant.

| Parts                   | Comp cost          | Comm cost   | Comp/comm ratio   | Scalability | Memory usage (B)     |
|-------------------------|--------------------|-------------|-------------------|-------------|----------------------|
| Modularity optim.       | $10(E + V) /p$     | $20V$ bytes | $E/p : 2V$        | Okay        | $88E/p + 12V$        |
| Graph contraction       | $5E / p + E'$      | $8E'$ bytes | $5E/p + E' : 8E'$ | Hard        | $16E'$               |
| Louvain                 | $10(E + V) / p$    | $20V$ bytes | $E/p : 2V$        | Okay        | $88E/p + 12V + 16E'$ |

Louvain could be hard to implement on multiple GPUs, especially for the graph
contraction phase, as it forms a new graph and distributes it across the GPUs.
But the scalability should be okay.

### GraphSAGE

The main memory usage and computation of SAGE are related to the
features of vertices. While directly accessing the feature data of
neighbors via peer access is possible and memory-efficient, it will
create a huge amount of inter-GPU traffic that makes SAGE unscalable
in terms of running time. Using UVM to store the feature data is also
possible, but that will move the traffic from inter-GPU to the GPU-CPU
connection, which is even less desirable. Although there is a risk of
using up the GPU memory, especially on graphs that have high
connectivity, a more scalable way is to duplicate the feature data of
neighboring vertices. Depending on the graph size and the size of
features, not all of the above data distribution schemes are
applicable. The following analysis focuses on the feature duplication
scheme, with other schemes' results in the summary table.

SAGE can be separated into three parts, depending on whether the computation
and data access is source-centric or child-centric.

```
// Part1: Select the children
For each source in local batch:
    Select num_children_per_source children form source's neighbors;
    Send <source, child> pairs to host_GPU(child);

// Part2: Child-centric computation
For each received <source, child> pair:
    child_feature = feature[child];
    send child_feature to host_GPU(source);

    feature_sums := {0};
    For i from 1 to num_leaves_per_child:
        Select a leaf from child's neighbors;
        leaves_feature += feature[leaf];
    child_temp = L2_normalize( concatenate(
        feature[child] * Wf1, leaves_feature * Wa1));
    send child_temp to host_GPU(source);

// Part3: Source-centric computation
For each source in local batch:
    children_feature := sum(received child_feature);
    children_temp := sum(received child_temp);
    source_temp := L2_normalize( concatenate(
        feature[source] * Wf1, children_feature * Wa1));

    source_result := L2_normalize( concatenate(
        source_temp * Wf2, children_temp * Wa2));
```

Assume the size of local batch is B, the number of children per source is C,
the number of leaves per child is L, and the feature length per vertex is F.
Dimensions of 2D matrices are noted as (x, y). The
computation and communication costs for each part are:

```
Part 1, computation  : B x C.
Part 1, communication: B x C x 8 bytes.
Part 2, computation  : B x C x F + B x C x (F + L x F + F x (Wf1.y + Wa1.y)).
Part 2, communication: B x C x (F + Wf1.y + Wa1.y) x 4 bytes.
Part 3, computation  : B x (C x (F + Wf1.y + Wa1.y) + F x (Wf1.y + Wa1.y) +
                       (Wf1.y + Wa1.y) x (Wf2.y + Wa2.y)).
Part 3, communication: 0.
```

For Part 2's communication, if C is larger than about 2p, using `AllReduce` to
sum up `child_feature` and `child_temp` for each source will cost less, at $B \times (F + \textrm{Wf1}.y + \textrm{Wa1}.y) \times 2p \times 4$ bytes.

*Summary of Graph SAGE multi-GPU scaling*

| Parts                 | Computation cost | Communication cost (Bytes)    | Comp. to comm. ratio | Scalability |
|-----------------------|------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------|-------------|
| **Feature duplication** | | | | |
| Children selection    | $BC$ | $8BC$ | 1 : 8 | Poor |
| Child-centric comp.   | $BCF \cdot (2 + L + \textrm{Wf1}.y + \textrm{Wa1}.y)$ | $4B \cdot (F + \textrm{Wf1}.y + \textrm{Wa1}.y) \cdot \min(C, 2p)$ | $\sim CF : \min(C, 2p) \cdot 4$ | Good |
| Source-centric comp.  | $B \cdot (CF + (\textrm{Wf1}.y + \textrm{Wa1}.y) \cdot (C + F + \textrm{Wf2}.y + \textrm{Wa2}.y)$ | 0 | N.A. | N.A. |

| Graph SAGE            | $B \cdot (C + 3CF + 3LCF + (\textrm{Wf1}.y + \textrm{Wa1}.y) \cdot (CF + C + F + \textrm{Wf2}.y + \textrm{Wa2}.y))$ | $8BC + 4B \cdot (F + \textrm{Wf1}.y + \textrm{Wa1}.y) \cdot \min(C, 2p) + 4BCFL$ | $\sim (2 + L + \textrm{Wf1}.y + \textrm{Wa1}.y) : 4L$ | poor |
| | | | | |
| **Feature in UVM**      | | | | |
| Child-centric comp.   | $BCF \cdot (2 + L + \textrm{Wf1}.y + \textrm{Wa1}.y)$ | $4B \cdot (F + \textrm{Wf1}.y + \textrm{Wa1}.y) \cdot \min(C, 2p)$ bytes over GPU-GPU + $4BCLF$ bytes over GPU-CPU | $\sim (2 + L + \textrm{Wf1}.y + \textrm{ a1}.y) : 4L$ over GPU-CPU | very poor |
| Graph SAGE            | $B \cdot (C + 3CF + 3LCF + (\textrm{Wf1}.y + \textrm{Wa1}.y) \cdot (CF + C + F + \textrm{Wf2}.y + \textrm{Wa2}.y))$ | $8BC + 4B \cdot (F + \textrm{Wf1}.y + \textrm{Wa1}.y) \cdot \min(C, 2p)$ bytes over GPU-GPU + $4BCFL$ bytes over GPU-CPU | $\sim (2 + L + \textrm{Wf1}.y + \textrm{Wa1}.y) : 4L$ over GPU-CPU | very poor |


When the number of features is at least several tens, the computation workload
will be much more than communication, and SAGE should have good scalability.
Implementation should be easy, as only simple p2p or AllReduce communication
models are used. If memory usage is an issue, falling back to peer-access or
UVM will result in very poor scalability; problem segmentation (i.e,. only
process portion of the graph at a time) may be necessary to have a scalable
implementation for large graphs, but that will be quite complex.

### Random walks and graph search

If the graph can be duplicated on each GPU, the random walk multi-GPU
implementation is trivial: just do a subset of the walks on each GPU. The
scalability will be perfect, as there is no communication involved at all.

A more interesting multi-GPU implementation would be when the graph is
distributed across the GPUs. In this case, each step of a walk not only needs
to send the `<walk#, step#, v>` information to `host_GPU(v)`, but also to the GPU that
stores the result for such walk.

```
For each walk starting from local vertex v:
    Store v for ;
    Select a neighbor u of v;
    Store u for ;
    Send  to host_GPU(u) for visit;

Repeat until all steps of walks finished:
    For each received  for visit:
        Select a neighbor u of v;
        Send  to host_GPU(u) for visit;
        Send  to host_GPU_walk(walk#) for record;

    For each received  for record:
        Store v for ;
```

Using W as the number of walks, for each step, we have

| Parts                 | Comp. cost   | Comm. cost      | Comp/comm ratio  | Scalability |
|-----------------------|--------------|-----------------|------------------|-------------|
| Random walk           | $W/p$        | $W/p \cdot 24$ bytes| $1 : 24$         | very poor   |

Graph search is very similar to random walk, except that instead of
randomly selecting any neighbor, it selects the neighbor with the
highest score (when using the `greedy` strategy), or with probabilities
proportional to the neighbors' scores (when using the `stochastic_greedy`
strategy). For the `greedy` strategy, a straightforward implementation, when
reaching a vertex, goes through the whole neighbor list of thatsuch
vertex and finds the one with maximum score. A more optimized implementation
could perform a pre-visit to find the neighbor with
maximum scored neighbor, with a cost of $E/p$; during the random walk
process, the maximum scored neighbor will be known without going
through the neighbor list.

For the `stochastic_greedy` strategy, the straightforward implementation would
also go through all the neighbors, selecting one based on their scores and a
random number. Preprocessing can also help: perform a scan on the scores of
each vertex's neighbor list, with a cost of $E/p$; during the random walk, a binary search would be
sufficient to select a neighbor, with weighted probabilities.

The cost analysis, depending on the walk strategy and optimization,
                          results in:

| Strategy          | Comp. cost              | Comm. cost       | Comp/comm ratio | Scalability |
|-------------------|-------------------------|------------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Uniform           | $W/p$                   | $W/p \cdot 24$ bytes | $1 : 24$        | Very poor   |
| Greedy            | Straightforward: $dW/p$ | $W/p \cdot 24$ bytes | $d : 24$        | Poor        |
| Greedy            | Pre-visit: $W/p$        | $W/p \cdot 24$ bytes | $1 : 24$        | Very poor   |
| Stochastic Greedy | Straightforward: $dW/p$ | $W/p \cdot 24$ bytes | $d : 24$        | Poor        |
| Stochastic Greedy | Pre-visit: $log(d)W/p$  | $W/p \cdot 24$ bytes | $log(d) : 24$   | Very poor   |

If the selection of a neighbor is weighted-random, instead of uniformly-random,
it will increase the computation workload to Wd /p, where d is the average
degree of vertices in the graph. As a result, the computation-to-communication
ratio will increase to d:24; for most graphs, this is still not high enough to
have good scalability.

### Geolocation
In each iteration, Geolocation updates a vertex's location based on
its neighbors. For multiple GPUs, neighboring vertices's location
information needs to be available, either by direct access, UVM, or
explicit data movement. The following shows how explicit data movement
can be implemented.

```
Do
    Local geo location updates on local vertices;
    Broadcast local vertices' updates;
While no more update
```

The computation cost is on the order of O(|E|/p), if in each iteration
all vertices are looking for possible location updates from neighbors.
Because the spatial median function has a lot of mathematical
computation inside, particularly a haversine() for each edge, the
constant factor hidden by O() is large; for simplicity, 100 is used as
the constant factor here. Assuming that we broadcast every vertex's
location gives the upper bound of communication, but in reality, the
communication should be much less, because 1) not every vertex updates
its location every iteration and 2) vertices may not have neighbors on
each GPU, so instead of broadcast, p2p communication may be used to
reduce the communication cost, especially when the graph connectivity
is low.

| Comm. method          | Comp. cost   | Comm. cost      | Comp/comm ratio | Scalability |
|-----------------------|--------------|-----------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Explicit movement     | $100E/p$     | $2V \cdot 8$ bytes  | $25E/p : 4V$    | Okay        |
| UVM or peer access    | $100E/p$     | $E/p \cdot 8$ bytes | $25 : 1$        | Good        |

### Vertex Nomination

Vertex nomination is very similar to a single source shortest path
(SSSP) problem, except it starts from a group of vertices, instead of
a single source. One possible multi-GPU implementation is:

```
Set the starting vertex / vertices;
While has new distance updates
    For each local vertex v with distance update:
        For each edge <v, u, w> of vertex v:
            new_distance := distance[v] + w;
            if (distance[u] > new_distance)
                distance[u] = new_distance;

    For each u with distance update:
        Send <u, distance[u]> to host_GPU(u);
```

Assuming on average, each vertex has its distance updated `a` times, and the
average degree of vertices is `d`, the computation and the communication costs are:

| Parts         | Comp. cost | Comm. cost                   | Comp/comm ratio      | Scalability |
|---------------|------------|------------------------------|----------------------|-------------|
| Vertex nomination | $aE/p$     | $aV/p \cdot \min(d, p) \cdot 8$ bytes | $E : 8V \cdot \min(d, p)$ | Okay        |

The $\min(d, p)$ part in the communication cost comes from update
aggregation on each GPU: when a vertex has more than one distance
update, only the smallest is sent out; a vertex that has a lot of
neighbors and is connected to all GPUs has its communication cost
capped by $p \times 8$ bytes.

### Scan Statistics

Scan statistics is essentially triangle counting (TC) for each vertex
plus a simple post-processing step. The current Gunrock TC
implementation is intersection-based: for an edge `<v, u>`,
intersecting `neighbors[u]` and `neighbors[v]` gives the number of
triangles including `edge <v, u>`. This
neighborhood-intersection-based algorithm only works if the
neighborhood of end points of all edges for which we need to count
triangles can reside in the memory of a single GPU. For graphs with
low connectivities, such as road networks and meshes, it is still
possible to partition the graph; for graphs with high connectivity,
such as social networks or some web graphs, it's almost impossible to
partition the graph, and any sizable partition of the graph may touch
a large portion of vertices of the graph. As a result, for general
graphs, the intersection-based algorithm requires the graph can be
duplicated on each GPU. Under this condition, the multi-GPU
implementation is trivial: only count triangles for a subset of edges
on each GPU, and no communication is involved.

A more distributed-friendly TC algorithm is wedge-checking-based
(<https://e-reports-ext.llnl.gov/pdf/890544.pdf>). The main idea is
this: for each triangle A-B-C, where `degree(A) >= degree(B) >=
degree(C)`, both A and B are in C's neighborhood, and A is in B's
neighborhood; when testing for possible triangle D-E-F, with
`degree(D) >= degree(E) >= degree(F)`, the wedge (two edges that share
the same end point) that needs to be checked is D-E, and the checking
can be simply done by verifying whether D is in E's neighborhood. As
this algorithm is designed for distributed systems, it should be
well-suited for multi-GPU system. The ordering requirements are
imposed to reduce the number of wedge checks and to balance the
workload. The multi-GPU pseudo code is:

```
For each local edge < v, u >:
    If (degree(v) > degree(u)) continue;
    For each neighbor w of v:
        If (degree(v) > degree(w)) continue;
        If (degree(u) > degree(w)) continue;
        Send tuple <u, w, v> to host_GPU(u) for checking;

For each received tuple < u, w, v >:
    If (w in u's neighbor list):
        triangles[u] ++;
        triangles[w] ++;
        triangles[v] ++;

AllReduce(triangles, sum);

// For Scan statistics only
For each vertex v in the graph:
    scan_stat[v] := triangles[v] + degree(v);
    if (scan_stat[v] > max_scan_stat):
        max_scan_stat := scan_stat[v];
        max_ss_node := v;
```

Using T as the number of triangles in the graph, the number of wedge
checks is normally a few times $T$, noted as $aT$. For the three
graphs tested by the LLNL paper---Twitter, WDC 2012, and Rmat-Scale
34---$a$ ranges from 1.5 to 5. The large number of wedges can use up
the GPU memory, if they are stored and communicated all at once. The
solution is to generate a batch of wedges and check them, then
generate another batch and check them, loop until all wedges are
checked.

Assuming the neighbor lists of every vertex are sorted, the membership checking
can be done in log(#neighbors). As a result, using $d$ as the average outdegree
of vertices, the cost analysis is:

| Parts                 | Comp. cost | Comm. cost (B)   | Comp/comm ratio | Scalability |
|-----------------------|------------|---------------|----------------------|-------------|
| Wedge generation      | $dE/p$     |                 | | |
| Wedge communication   | $0$        | $aE/p \cdot 12$   | | |
| Wedge checking        | $aE/p \cdot \log(d)$ |            | | |
| AllReduce             | $2V$         | $2V \cdot 4$  | | |
| Triangle Counting     | $(d \cdot a \cdot \log(d))E/p + 2V$ | $aE/p \cdot 12 + 8V$ | $\sim (d + a \cdot \log(d)) : 12a$ | Okay |
| Scan Statistics (with wedge checks)| $(d \cdot a \cdot \log(d))E/p + 2V + V/p$ | $12aE/p + 8V$ | $\sim (d + a \cdot \log(d)) : 12a$ | Okay |
| Scan Statistics (with intersection) | $Vdd + V/p$ | $8V$ | $dd : 8$ | Perfect |

### Sparse Fused Lasso (GTF)

The sparse fused lasso iteration is mainly a max-flow (MF), plus some
per-vertex calculation to update the capacities in the graph. The reference and
most non-parallel implementations of MF are augmenting-path-based; but finding
the argumenting path and subsequent residual updates are both serial. The
push-relabel algorithm is more parallelizable, and used by Gunrock's MF
implementation. Each time the push operation updates the flow on an edge, it
also needs to update the flow on the reverse edge; but the reverse edge may be
hosted by another GPU, and that creates a large amount of inter-GPU traffic. The
pseudocode for one iteration of MF with inter-GPU communication is:

```
// Push phase
For each local vertex v:
    If (excess[v] <= 0) continue;
    If (v == source || v == sink) continue;
    For each edge e<v, u> of v:
        If (capacity[e] <= flow[e]) continue;
        If (height[v] <= height[u]) continue;
        move := min(capacity[e] - flow[e], excess[v]);
        excess[v] -= move;
        flow[e] += move;
        Send <reverse[e], move> to host_GPU(u);
        If (excess[v] <= 0)
            break for each e loop;

For each received <e, move> pair:
    flow[e] -= move;
    excess[Dest(e)] += move;

// Relabel phase
For each local vertex v:
    If (excess[v] <= 0) continue;
    min_height := infinity;
    For each e<v, u> of v:
        If (capacity[e] <= flow[e]) continue;
        If (min_height > height[u])
            min_height = height[u];
    If (height[v] <= min_height)
        height[v] := min_height + 1;

Broadcast height[v] for all local vertex;
```

The cost analysis will not be on one single iteration, but on a full run of the
push-relabel algorithm, as the bounds of the push and the relabel operations
are known.

| Parts | Comp. cost | Comm. cost (Bytes) | Comp/comm ratio | Scalability |
|-------|------------|---------------|----------|-------------|
| Push  | $a(V + 1)VE/p$ | $(V+1)VE/p \cdot 8$ | $a:8$ | Less than okay |
| Relabel | $VE/p$ | $V^2 \cdot 8$ | $d/p : 8$ | Okay |
| MF (Push-Relabel) | $(aV + a + 1)VE/p$ | $V^2((V+1)d/p + 1) \cdot 8$ | $\sim a:8$ | Less than okay |

The GTF-specific parts are more complicated than MF in terms of
communication: the implementation must keep some data, such as weights
and sizes, for each community of vertices, and multiple GPUs could be
updating such data simultaneously. It's almost impossible to do
explicit data movement for this part, and the best option is to use
direct access or UVM; each vertex may update its community once, so
the communication cost is still manageable. One iteration of GTF is:


```
MF;
BFS to find the min-cut;
Vertex-Community updates;
Updates source-vertex and vertex-destination capacities;
```

with scaling characteristics:


| Parts | Comp. cost | Comm. cost (Bytes)    | Comp/comm ratio | Scalability |
|-------|------------|---------------|---------|-------------|
| MF (Push-Relabel) | $(aV + a + 1)VE/p$ | $V^2((V+1)d/p + 1) \cdot 8$ | $\sim a:8$ | Less than okay |
| BFS   | $E/p$        | $2V \cdot 4$  | $d/p : 8$              | Okay |
| V-C updates | $E/p$ | $V/p \cdot 8$  | $d : 8$                | Okay |
| Capacity updates | $V/p$ | $V/p \cdot 4$ | $1 : 4$            | Less than okay |
| GTF | $(aV + a + 1)VE/p$ | $V^2((V+1)d/p + 1) \cdot 8$ | $\sim a:8$ | Less than okay |
|| $+ 2E/p + V/p$ | $+ 2V x 4 + V/p \cdot 4$ | | |


It's unsurprising that GTF may not scale: the compute- and
communicate-heavy part of GTF is the MF, and in MF, each push needs
communication to update its reverse edge. A more distributed-friendly
MF algorithm is needed to overcome this problem.

### Graph Projection

Graph projection is very similar to triangle counting by wedge
checking; but instead of counting the triangles, it actually records
the wedges. The problem here is not computation or communication, but
rather the memory requirement of the result: projecting all vertices
may create a very dense graph, which may be much larger than the
original graph. One possible solution is to process the results in
batches:


```
vertex_start := 0;
While (vertex_start < num_vertices)
    markers := {0};
    current_range := [vertex_start, vertex_start + batch_size);
    For each local edge e<v, u> with u in current_range:
        For each neighbor t of v:
            If (u == t) continue;
            markers[(u - vertex_start) * ceil(num_vertices / 32) + t / 32] |=
                1 << (t % 32);

    For each vertex u in current_range:
        Form the neighbor list of u in the new graph by markers;

    For each local edge e<v, u> with u in current_range:
        For each neighbor t of v:
            If (u == t) continue;
            e' := edge_id of <u, t> in the new graph,
                by searching u's neighbor list;
            edge_values[e'] += 1;

    For each edge e'<u, t, w> in the new graph:
        send <u, t, w> to host_GPU(u);

    Merge all received <u, t, w> to form projection
        for local vertices u in current_range;
    Move the result from GPU to CPU;

    vertex_start += batch_size;
```

Using $E'$ to denote the number of edges in the projected graph, and
$d$ to denote the average degree of vertices, the costs are:


| Parts | Comp. cost | Comm. cost    | Comp/comm ratio | Scalability |
|-------|------------|---------------|----------------------|-------------|
| Marking | $dE/p$     | $0$ bytes       | | |
| Forming edge lists | $E'$ | $0$ bytes| | |
| Counting | $dE/p$ | $0$ bytes| | |
| Merging  | $E'$ | $E' \cdot 12$ bytes | | |
| Graph Projection | $2dE/p + 2E'$ | $12E'$ bytes | $dE/p + E' : 6E'$ | Okay |


If the graph can be duplicated on each GPU, instead of processing
distributed edges, each GPU can process only `u` vertices that are
hosted on that GPU. This eliminates the merging step; as a result,
there is no communication needed, and the computation cost reduces to
2dE/p + E'.

### Local Graph Clustering

The Gunrock implementation of Local Graph Clustering (LGC) uses
PageRank-Nibble, a variant of the PageRank algorithm. PR-Nibble's
communication pattern is the same as standard PR: accumulate changes
for each vertex to its host GPU. As a result, PR-Nibble should be
scalable, just as standard PR. PR-Nibble with communication can be
done as:

```
// Per-vertex updates
For each active local vertex v:
    If (iteration == 0 && v == src\_neighbor) continue;
    If (iteration > 0 && v == src)
        gradient[v] -= alpha / #reference_vertices / sqrt(degree(v));
    z[v] := y[v] - gradient[v];
    If (z[v] == 0) continue;

    q_old := q[v];
    threshold := rho * alpha * sqrt(degree(v));
    If (z[v] >= threshold)
        q[v] := z[v] - threshold;
    Else if (z[v] <= -threshold)
        q[v] := z[v] + threshold;
    Else
        q[v] := 0;

    If (iteration == 0)
        y[v] := q[v];
    Else
        y[v] := q[v] + ((1 - sqrt(alpha)) / (1 + sqrt(alpha))
                        * (q[v] - old_q));

    gradient[v] := y[v] * (1 + alpha) / 2;

// Ranking propagation
For each edge e<v, u> of active local vertex v:
    change := y[v] * (1 - alpha) / 2 / sqrt(degree(v)) / sqrt(degree(u));
    gradient_update[u] -= change;

For each u that has gradient updates:
    send < u, gradient_update[u]> to host_GPU(u);

For each received gradient update < u, gradient_update>:
    gradient[u] += gradient_update;

// Gradient updates
For each local vertex u with gradient updated:
    If (gradient[u] == 0) continue;
    Set u as active for next iteration;

    val := gradient[u];
    If (u == src)
        val -= (alpha / #reference_vertices) / sqrt(degree(u));
    val := abs(val / sqrt(degree(u)));
    if (gradient_scale_value < val)
        gradient_scale_value = val;
    if (val > gradient_threshold)
        gradient_scale := 1;
```

The cost analysis is:

| Parts | Comp. cost | Comm. cost    | Comp/comm ratio | Scalability |
|-------|------------|---------------|----------------------|-------------|
| Per-vertex updates  | $\sim 10 V/p$ | $0$ bytes | | |
| Ranking propagation | $2E/p$ | $V \cdot 8$ bytes | $d/p : 4$ | |
| Gradient updates    | $V/p$ | $0$ bytes | | |
| Local graph clustering | $(12V + 2E)/p$ | $8V$ bytes | $(6 + d)/p : 4$ | good |

### Seeded Graph Matching and Application Classification

The implementations of these two applications are
linear-algebra-based, as opposed to other applications where we used
Gunrock and its native graph (vertex-edge) data structures. The
linear-algebra-based (BLAS-based) formulations, especially the ones
that require matrix-matrix multiplications, may impose a large
communication requirement. Advance matrix-matrix and vector-matrix
multiplication kernels use optimizations that build on top of a
specific layout of the data, which may be not distribution-friendly. A
different method of analyzing the computation and the communication
costs---the computation vs. communication ratio---is needed for these
applications.

Seeded graph matching and application classification are
matrix-operation-based and not covered in this table.

From the scaling analysis, we can see these workflows can be roughly
grouped into three categories, by their scalabilities:

**Good scalability** GraphSAGE, geolocation using UVM or peer
accesses, and local graph clustering belong to this group. They share
some algorithmic signatures: the whole graph needs to be visited at
least once in every iteration, and visiting each edge involves
nontrivial computation. The communication costs are roughly at the
level of $V$. As a result, the computation vs. communication ratio is
larger than $E : V$. PageRank is a standard graph algorithm that falls
in this group.

**Moderate scalability** This group includes Louvain, geolocation
using explicit movement, vertex nomination, scan statistics, and graph
projection. They either only visit part of the graph in an iteration,
have only trivial computation during an edge visit, or communicate a
little more data than $V$. The computation vs. communication is less
than $E : V$, but still larger than 1 (or 1 operation : 4 bytes). They
are still scalable on the DGX-1 system, but not as well as the
previous group. Single source shortest path (SSSP) is an typical
example for this group.

**Poor scalability** Random walk, graph search, and sparse fused lasso
belong to this group. They need to send out some data for each vertex
or edge visit. As a result, the computation vs communication ratio is
less than 1 (or 1 operation : 4 bytes). They are very hard to scale
across multiple GPUs. Random walk is an typical example.
